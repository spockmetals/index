</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Q. What is It's A Women's World about?  <br>
A. It's A Women's World is envisioned to be a forum where women's rights activists, femenist and others can come together to disucss the issues on the topics, share news, discuss advancments and overall particiate toward the common goal of advancement of women's rights without the fear of outside censorships by different groups, goverenment agencies and any other kind of interfering elements.</p>
<p>Q. What is web3 and how does it help in preventing censorships? <br>
A. Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics. Due to incorporation of blockchain technology, no single agency, group, goverment or any other body has the ability to shut down all the nodes hosting the data. It is being touted as "content by the end user, for the end user, owned by the enduser". Adding to that the inherent trustless model, token economy and blockchain wallets provides a high level of anonimity that can help prevent personal censorship. We are building the website in such a way that after it is done being completed, even the developers of website won't have any more rights to alter the website than any other end user.</p>
<p>Q. What is preventing some miscreant to use this blog for there own nefarious purpose if there is no oversight? <br>
A. As answered above, Web3 is envisioned to be iteration of web where the end users of a website are also the one who owns a little part of it.   </p>
<p><img alt="Web1 is past, Web2 is the present but Web3 is the future" src="/images/faq/Web3.png">   </p>
<p>Hence the end users who owns the tokens, supplied in form of our own NFT on <a href="www.opensea.io">OpenSea</a>, would have a right in making decision about various issues that come up from time to time.</p>
<p>Q. What would be my powers if I do end up owning a token controlling the website? <br>
A. First of all, we want to make it very clear that owning the token won't mean that you'll end up owning this website. What it does mean is that you would be a part owner of creative direction this website takes by putting up your own ideas, reporting and voting on posts that you find are either not in the interest of women empowerment or are off topic that the original purpose of this website. We're hoping that once this website is finally done developing, with all the bugs, if any, sorted out, the developer would also have same rights as an any other enduser. Please check the roadmap section to see features we are planning to introduce in upcoming versions of website.</p>
<p>Q. What would be the powers of end users owning NFT in deciding the direction of "It's A Women's World"? <br>
A. FIrst of all, owning any single token(NST) is what would allow you to post your thoughts on the blog. Same is not required just to read that content once it's published. Also, they would allow the colletive users would have voting right that will decide various factors of website, including but not limited to selection of particular user(s) as moderator for any debate(hosted or otherwise), voting on whether a post is in line with the women empowerment agenda and if not should it be removed from the website or not, interact directly with other token owners to discuss and share thoughts, interact with devs while the website is under develpoment phase to suggest any new functionality or feature you think might benefit the fourm on whole, etc. All the above features are already included in roadmap section of the website, along their estimated ETA.</p>                </article>
